# Reflective Bond

*A Lumi Studio Micro-Reflection Tool for Softening the Heart & Mending Bonds*

Reflective Bond is a lightweight, private, browser-based reflection experience designed to help users:

1. Release emotional charge
2. Breathe and regulate
3. Reconnect with what they still appreciate about another person
4. Generate a meaningful reflection card to keep or share

No login. No database. All writing stays on the user's device unless they choose to download or share it.
